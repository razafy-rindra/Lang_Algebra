  \paragraph*{Galois connections}

  \begin{bergman}
    The FTG is an example of a general type of mathematical situation
    \begin{definition}
      Let $S,T$ be sets and $R\subseteq S\times T$ be a binary relation on them. For every subset $X\subseteq S$ we define \[
        X^\ast = \{t\in T\mid (\forall s\in X), \ (s,t)\in R\}\subseteq T  
      \]
      And likewise for every subset $Y\subseteq T$ we define\[
        Y^\ast = \{s\in S\mid (\forall t\in Y), \ (s,t)\in R\}\subseteq S  
      \] 

      These operators constitute what is called the \textbf{Galois connection} between $S$ and $T$.
    \end{definition}
    So note in our case, $S$ is an extension field $K$ of $k$, $T = \Gal{K/k}$ and $R$ is the relation \[\{(x,\sigma)\in K\times \Gal{K/k}\mid \sigma(x) = x \}\]
  
  \begin{Properties}
    \item $X\subseteq X' \Rightarrow X^\ast \supseteq X'^\ast$
    \item The operators $\ast\ast$ from $P(S)\rightarrow P(S)$ and  $P(T)\rightarrow P(T)$, are the \textit{closure operators} on $S$ and $T$, i.e.\begin{itemize}
      \item $X\subseteq X^{\ast\ast}$
      \item $X\subseteq Y\Rightarrow X^{\ast\ast}\subseteq Y^{\ast\ast}$
      \item ${(X^{\ast\ast})}^{\ast\ast} = X^{\ast\ast}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item The operators $\ast$ give a bujective inclusion-reversing correspondence between closed subsets of $S$ and closed subsets of $T$ wrt to these operators.
  \end{Properties}
  \end{bergman}

  \section{Examples and Applications}
  \begin{bergman}
    Let $K$ be a finite field, say $\F_{p^n}$, recall the Frobenius map is an automorphism in this case, furthermore we recall that this map fixes $\F_p$. Furthermore the Frobenius map has finite order, so by Artin
    it generates the group $\Gal{\F_{p^n}/\F_{p}}$. Thus each field $\F_{p^n}$ is a Galois extension of $\F_{p}$ with cyclic Galois group, which must have order $[\F_{p^n}, \F_{p}] = n$.

    We can see that for every $m$ dividing $n$, the sugroup generated by the $m$th power of the Frobenius map corresponds to a subfield $\F_{p^m}\subseteq \F_{p^n}$ 
  \end{bergman}
  
  \begin{definition}\index{Galois group}
    Let $k$ be a field and $f(X)$ a seperable polynomial of degree $\geq 1$ in $k[X]$. Let \[
        f(X) = (X-\alpha_1)\cdots (X-\alpha_n)  
    \]

    be its factorization in a splitting field $K$ over $k$. If $G$ is the Galois group of $K$ over $k$, we call $G$ the \textbf{Galois group} of $f$ over $k$. 
    Since the elements of $G$ permute the roots of $f$, we have an injective homomorphism of $G$ into the symmetric group $S_n$. 
  \end{definition}
  \paragraph*{Quadratic extensions}
  \begin{example}
    Let $k$ be a field and $a\in k$. If $a$ is not a square in $k$, then the polynomial $X^2-a$ has no root in $k$ and is therefore irreducible.
  
    Assume $char k\neq 2$. Let $\alpha$ be a root, this polynomial is separable since $-\alpha\neq \alpha$, and so $k(\alpha)$ is the splitting field, is Galois and it's Galois group is cyclic of order $2$.
  
    Conversely, given an extension $K$ of $k$ of degree $2$, there exists $a\in k$ such that $K = k(\alpha)$ and $\alpha^2 = a$. (Indeed since if $x^2 + bx + c = 0\Rightarrow {(x + \frac{b}{2})}^2 = -(\frac{b^2}{4} + c)\in k$, so we let $\alpha = x + \frac{b}{2}$)
  \end{example}

  \paragraph*{Cubic extensions}
  \begin{example}
    Let $k$ be a field not of characteristic $2$ nor $3$. Let \[
      f(X) = X^3 + aX +b  
    \]
    Be any polynomial of degree $3$ can be brought into this form (depressed cubic). Assume that $f$ has no root in $k$. Then $f$ is irreducible. Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f(X)$, Then $[k(\alpha)\colon k] = 3$.

    Let $K$ be the splitting field, since $char k\neq 2,3$, $f$ is separable, so let $G$ be the Galois group. Then $G$ has order $3$ or $6$ since $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_3$. In the second case $k(\alpha)$ is not normal over $k$, this is because the corresponding group is the stablizer of $1\in \{1,2,3\}$ in $S_3$ which is not a normal subgroup.
    
    \subparagraph*{How do we test whether the Galois group is the full symmmetric group?}
    We will consider the discriminant, if $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$ are the distinct roots of $f(X)$ we let\[
      \delta = (\alpha_1-\alpha_2)(\alpha_2-\alpha_3)(\alpha_1-\alpha_3) \text{ and }\Delta = \delta^2  
    \]
    If $G$ is the Galois groups and $\sigma\in G$, then $\sigma(\delta) = \pm \delta$. Hence $\sigma$ leaves $\Delta$ fised. Thus $\Delta$ is in the ground field $k$. Furthermore we have seen that \[
      \Delta = -4a^3-27b^2  
    \]
	The set of $\sigma$ in $G$ which leave $\delta$ fixed is precisely the set of even permutations.
	\begin{bergman}
		Let us develop formally the corresponding result for equations of arbitrary degree. Note that $D$ and $\delta$ are the polynomials 
		\begin{align*}
			\delta(t) &= \prod_{i<j}(t_i-t_j)\\
			D = D(s_1,\ldots,s_n)&= \prod_{i<j}{(t_i-t_j)}^2
		\end{align*}
    \begin{lemma}
      Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $D\in \Z[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be the discriminant polynomial. That is the unique polynomial such that in the polynomial ring $\Z[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$, if one writes $s_i$ for the $ith$ elementary symmetric polynomial in the $t_i$, we have \[
          \prod_{i<j} {(t_i-t_j)}^2 = D(s_1,\ldots,s_n)  
      \]

      For any field $k$ not of characteristic $2$ and any seperable monic polynomial $f = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+\cdots + a_0$, if we denote by $E$ the splitting field of $f$ and by $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ the roots of $f$ in $E$, then TFAE:\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item $\Gal{E/k}$, regarded as a group of permutations of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ lies in the alternating group $A_n$, i.e. acts by even permutations on these roots.
        \item The element $\delta(\alpha) = \prod_{i<j}(\alpha_i-\alpha_j)$ of $E$ lies in $k$.
        \item The element $D(a_{n-1},\ldots,a_0)\in k$ is  asquare in $k$
      \end{enumerate}
      Hence the fixed field of the group of elements of $\Gal{E/k}$ which act by even permutations on the roots of $f$ is $k(\delta(\alpha)) = k({D(a_{n-1},\ldots,a_0)}^{1/2})$.
